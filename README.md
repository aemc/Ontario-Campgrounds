# Ontario Campgrounds
* Personal Project. Ontario Campgrounds is a web application that aggregates information about camps all over Ontario in one place. New users can sign up, add/delete new camps, and make/edit their own comments.

### Built with:
* [NodeJS with Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### Running:
* Either run in the cloud9 IDE or in your own development environment. The latter will need the port settings changed within the app.js file.

### ToDoList:
- [x] Added Authentication and Authorization for users
- [x] Added comment date
- [ ] Polish front-end
- [ ] Deploy to Amazon Web Services/Heroku
